I am currently doing my **Research Master's in Computer Science at Mila (McGill University)** supervised by Prof. Reihaneh Rabbany and Prof. Guillaume Rabusseau. 
Previously I completed my undergraduate degree at the Department of Computer Engineering at **Sharif University of Technology** . My research interests currently are at intersection of Graph Learning and Tensor Networks.

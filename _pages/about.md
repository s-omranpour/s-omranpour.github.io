I am currently doing my **Research Master's in Computer Science at Mila & McGill University** under the supervision of Prof. Reihaneh Rabbany and Prof. Guillaume Rabusseau. 
Previously I completed my undergraduate degree at the Department of Computer Engineering at **Sharif University of Technology** . 

I am focused on the intersection of **graph learning, tensor networks, and natural language processing** at the moment. On-going projects:
 - A Tensor Transformer architecture that operates on multi-dimensional tensor data such as spatiotemporal signals or multivariate timeseries, etc.
 - A Dynamic Graph Learning method for Mental Health disorder detection on social media users.
 - A Multimodal method to perform stock market movement prediction from historical price data and social media text.

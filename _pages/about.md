I am a final year **Master's** student in Computer Science at (Mila)[https://mila.quebec] and (McGill University)[https://mcgill.ca] under the supervision of Prof. Reihaneh Rabbany and Prof. Guillaume Rabusseau. Previously I completed my undergraduate degree at the Department of Computer Engineering at (Sharif University of Technology)[https://sharif.edu]. I have a broad interest in graph neural networks, tensor factorization, foundation models, and music information retrieval. Currently, my research focuses on building scalable and efficient machine learning models for tensor-structured or highly complex and evolving data such as temporal graphs, multivariate timeseries, video, etc. For more information about my past experiences please look at my CV.
